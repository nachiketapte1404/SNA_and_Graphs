This is the project for the subject of Graph Theory and Social Network Analysis taught by Dr. Utkarsh Khaire

The groups members contributing in this project are:<br>
* Ayush Singh 22BDS012 <br>

The project aims to run quantitative analysis on the undirected graph of US Road Networks <br>
The dataset used in the project can be found in the road-usroads.mtx file in the roads-usroads folder or here: 
https://networkrepository.com/road-usroads.php
<br>
We have decided to run the following metrics for the quantitative analysis: 

- average degree
- count of triangles
- no of wcc
- no of scc
- degree centrality
- betweenness centrality
- diameter
- average path length
- shortest path
- closeness centrality
- average clustering coefficient
