This is the project for the subject of Graph Theory and Social Network Analysis taught by Dr. Utkarsh Khaire

The groups members contributing in this project are:
Ayush Singh 22BDS012
Nachiket Ganesh Apte 22BDS041
Parishri Rakesh Shah 22BDS043
Yashraj Kadam 22BDS066

The project aims to run quantitative analysis on the undirected graph of US Road Networks
We have decided to run the following metrics for the quantitative analysis:

- average degree
- count of triangles
- no of wcc
- no of scc
- degree centrality
- betweenness centrality
- diameter
- average path length
- shortest path (Princeton algos)
- closeness centrality
